A Robust Hybrid Algorithm Using Worst-Case Optimization for Pesonal Sound Zones
# Description
'SFC.m' is the main function that is processed after the disturbance is added with Gaussian noise, reverberation and position perturbation.
## algorithm
Including various sound field control algorithms. Other folders are described below.
## data
The data set used in the experiment. Include ATF.mat and alpha.mat. This part of ATF data is too large to upload, and can be generated by rirgenerate.
## function
Other functions.
## results
The result graph of the experiment is given.
## rirGenerate
Generate room impulse response.
